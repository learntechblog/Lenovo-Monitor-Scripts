Scripts to manage multiple monitors on Lenovo laptops.

The save-settings script will save your display settings and panels, the load-settings script will restore them.

To save your monitor setup, use
./save-settings.sh configurationname
I use three configurations: "docked", "laptop", and "1monitor".
